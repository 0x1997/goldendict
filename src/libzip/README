****
This library was modified for GoldenDict by Konstantin Isakov
<ikm@users.berlios.de>. It was made to read central directory file entries
until no further entries could be read, disregarding the original file count
as specified in the end-of-central-dir record. This was done in order to make
larger zip archives (>65535 file entries) created by InfoZIP-based zips work.
The only file changed was zip_open.c.

The rest of the original README follows.

  This is libzip, a C library for reading, creating, and modifying zip
archives.  Files can be added from data buffers, files, or compressed
data copied directly from other zip archives.  Changes made without
closing the archive can be reverted.  The API is documented by man
pages.

  For more information, take a look at the included man pages.  You
can start with libzip(3), which lists all others.  Example source code
is in the src/ subdirectory.

  For generic installation instructions, see file `INSTALL'.
Additionally, you'll need zlib (at least version 1.1.2). It comes
with most operating systems nowadays, or you can get it at
	http://www.gzip.org/zlib/

  If you make a binary distribution, please include a pointer to the
distribution site:
	http://www.nih.at/libzip/
	ftp.nih.at /pub/nih/libzip
The latest version can always be found there.

Mail suggestions and bug reports to <libzip@nih.at>.
