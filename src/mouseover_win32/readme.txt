These files were taken straight from StarDict 3.0.1. They didn't seem to
bear any copyright notices, and as such, no new notices were added.
The only changes made were renaming some global ids to make sure that running
StarDict and GoldenDict simultaneously wouldn't interfere with each other.

The Makefile is made for mingw32 cross-compilation, and is completely separate
from the main program.
